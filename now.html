        <h2>Enjoying the weather</h2>
        <p>
            As absolutely horrific as the weather tends to be, it can still be enjoyable somtimes.<br>
            I've always enjoyed autumn, with the beautiful colors and cooler weather it was<br> 
            always far more pleasing to me than say, summer--with it's melting temperatures and high humidity.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            That's not to say I don't or haven't enjoyed summer, I certainly have. Most days though<br>
            are ruined by how miserable the heat becomes. Maybe I'm just sensitive to the heat<br>
            but I tend to melt just by standing around in your average Walmart.
